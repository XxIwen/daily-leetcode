[559. Maximum Depth of N-ary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-n-ary-tree/)
#### 题目描述
```
Given a n-ary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

Example 1:
```
![1](../../assets/tree/2020-11-06/1.png)
```
  Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
  Output: 3

Example 2:
```
![1](../../assets/tree/2020-11-06/2.png)
```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
Output: 5

Constraints:

  1. The depth of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to 1000.
  2. The total number of nodes is between [0, 10^4].

```
/**
 * // Definition for a Node.
 * function Node(val,children) {
 *    this.val = val;
 *    this.children = children;
 * };
 */

/**
 * @param {Node} root
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxDepth = function(root) {
    
};
```
