#### Problem Title
[226. Invert Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/)
#### Problem Description
```
Invert a binary tree.

Example:

Input:

     4
   /   \
  2     7
 / \   / \
1   3 6   9

Output:

     4

  7     2
 / \   / \
9   6 3   1

Trivia:
This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:

  Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you canâ€™t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so f*** off.
```

##### Code

- Solution One
```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {TreeNode}
 */
var invertTree = function(root) {
    
};
```
