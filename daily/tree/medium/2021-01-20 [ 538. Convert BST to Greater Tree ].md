#### Problem Title
[538. Convert BST to Greater Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-bst-to-greater-tree/)
#### Problem Description
```
Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.

As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:

    1. The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
    2. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
    3. Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Note: This question is the same as 1038: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search-tree-to-greater-sum-tree/
 
Example 1:
```
![1](../../assets/tree/2021-01-20/1.png)
```
  Input: root = [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]
  Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]

Example 2:

  Input: root = [0,null,1]
  Output: [1,null,1]

Example 3:

  Input: root = [1,0,2]
  Output: [3,3,2]

Example 4:

  Input: root = [3,2,4,1]
  Output: [7,9,4,10]
 
Constraints:

  1. The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
  2. -10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4
  3. All the values in the tree are unique.
  4. root is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
```
##### Code

- Solution One
```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {TreeNode}
 */
var convertBST = function(root) {
    
};
```
