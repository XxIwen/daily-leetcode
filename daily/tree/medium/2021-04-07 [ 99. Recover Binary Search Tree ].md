#### Problem Title
[99. Recover Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/recover-binary-search-tree/)
#### Problem Description
```
You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST), where exactly two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake. Recover the tree without changing its structure.

Follow up: A solution using O(n) space is pretty straight forward. Could you devise a constant space solution?

Example 1:
```
![1](../../assets/tree/2021-04-07/1.jpg)
```
  Input: root = [1,3,null,null,2]
  Output: [3,1,null,null,2]
  Explanation: 3 cannot be a left child of 1 because 3 > 1. Swapping 1 and 3 makes the BST valid.

Example 2:
```
![1](../../assets/tree/2021-04-07/2.jpg)
```
  Input: root = [3,1,4,null,null,2]
  Output: [2,1,4,null,null,3]
  Explanation: 2 cannot be in the right subtree of 3 because 2 < 3. Swapping 2 and 3 makes the BST valid.

Constraints:

    1. The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 1000].
    2. -2^31 <= Node.val <= 2^31 - 1
```
##### Code

- Solution One
```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify root in-place instead.
 */
var recoverTree = function(root) {
    
};
```
