[1315. Sum of Nodes with Even-Valued Grandparent](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-nodes-with-even-valued-grandparent/)
#### 题目描述
```
Given a binary tree, return the sum of values of nodes with even-valued grandparent.  (A grandparent of a node is the parent of its parent, if it exists.)

If there are no nodes with an even-valued grandparent, return 0.

Example 1:
```
![1](../../assets/tree/2020-12-06/1.png)
```
     Input: root = [6,7,8,2,7,1,3,9,null,1,4,null,null,null,5]
     Output: 18
     Explanation: The red nodes are the nodes with even-value grandparent while the blue nodes are the even-value grandparents.
 

Constraints:

     1. The number of nodes in the tree is between 1 and 10^4.
     2. The value of nodes is between 1 and 100.
```

- 解法一
```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {number}
 */
var sumEvenGrandparent = function(root) {
    
};
```
