#### Problem Title
[988. Smallest String Starting From Leaf](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-string-starting-from-leaf/)
#### Problem Description
```
Given the root of a binary tree, each node has a value from 0 to 25 representing the letters 'a' to 'z': a value of 0 represents 'a', a value of 1 represents 'b', and so on.

Find the lexicographically smallest string that starts at a leaf of this tree and ends at the root.

(As a reminder, any shorter prefix of a string is lexicographically smaller: for example, "ab" is lexicographically smaller than "aba".  A leaf of a node is a node that has no children.)

Example 1:
```
![1](../../assets/tree/2021-03-01/1.png)
```
  Input: [0,1,2,3,4,3,4]
  Output: "dba"

Example 2:
```
![1](../../assets/tree/2021-03-01/2.png)
```
  Input: [25,1,3,1,3,0,2]
  Output: "adz"

Example 3:
```
![1](../../assets/tree/2021-03-01/3.png)
```
  Input: [2,2,1,null,1,0,null,0]
  Output: "abc"
 
Note:

  1. The number of nodes in the given tree will be between 1 and 8500.
  2. Each node in the tree will have a value between 0 and 25.
```
##### Code

- Solution One
```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {string}
 */
var smallestFromLeaf = function(root) {
    
};
```
