[1110. Delete Nodes And Return Forest](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-nodes-and-return-forest/)
#### 题目描述
```
Given the root of a binary tree, each node in the tree has a distinct value.

After deleting all nodes with a value in to_delete, we are left with a forest (a disjoint union of trees).

Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest.  You may return the result in any order.

Example 1:
```
![1](../../assets/tree/2020-12-27/1.png)
```
  Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], to_delete = [3,5]
  Output: [[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]]
 

Constraints:

  1. The number of nodes in the given tree is at most 1000.
  2. Each node has a distinct value between 1 and 1000.
  3. to_delete.length <= 1000
  4. to_delete contains distinct values between 1 and 1000.
```

- 解法一
```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @param {number[]} to_delete
 * @return {TreeNode[]}
 */
var delNodes = function(root, to_delete) {
    
};
```
