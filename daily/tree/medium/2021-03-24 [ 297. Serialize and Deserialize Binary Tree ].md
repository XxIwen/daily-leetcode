#### Problem Title
[297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/)
#### Problem Description
```
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

Example 1:
```
![1](../../assets/tree/2021-03-24/1.jpg)
```
  Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
  Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]

Example 2:

  Input: root = []
  Output: []

Example 3:

  Input: root = [1]
  Output: [1]

Example 4:

  Input: root = [1,2]
  Output: [1,2]
 

Constraints:

  1. The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
  2. -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
```
##### Code

- Solution One
```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.left = this.right = null;
 * }
 */

/**
 * Encodes a tree to a single string.
 *
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {string}
 */
var serialize = function(root) {
    
};

/**
 * Decodes your encoded data to tree.
 *
 * @param {string} data
 * @return {TreeNode}
 */
var deserialize = function(data) {
    
};

/**
 * Your functions will be called as such:
 * deserialize(serialize(root));
 */
```
