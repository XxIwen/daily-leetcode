#### Problem Title
[450. Delete Node in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/)
#### Problem Description
```
Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

    1. Search for a node to remove.
    2. If the node is found, delete the node.
  
Follow up: Can you solve it with time complexity O(height of tree)?
 
Example 1:
```
![1](../../assets/tree/2021-03-09/1.jpg)
```
  Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
  Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
  Explanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.
  One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.
  Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's also accepted.
```

```
Example 2:

  Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0
  Output: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
  Explanation: The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.

Example 3:

  Input: root = [], key = 0
  Output: []
 

Constraints:

  1. The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
  2. -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
  3. Each node has a unique value.
  4. root is a valid binary search tree.
  5. -10^5 <= key <= 10^5
```
##### Code

- Solution One
```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @param {number} key
 * @return {TreeNode}
 */
var deleteNode = function(root, key) {
    
};
```
