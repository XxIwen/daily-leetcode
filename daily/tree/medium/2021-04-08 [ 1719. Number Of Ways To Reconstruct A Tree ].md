#### Problem Title
[1719. Number Of Ways To Reconstruct A Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-reconstruct-a-tree/)
#### Problem Description
```
You are given an array pairs, where pairs[i] = [xi, yi], and:

  1. There are no duplicates.
  2. xi < yi

Let ways be the number of rooted trees that satisfy the following conditions:

  1. The tree consists of nodes whose values appeared in pairs.
  2. A pair [xi, yi] exists in pairs if and only if xi is an ancestor of yi or yi is an ancestor of xi.
  3. Note: the tree does not have to be a binary tree.

Two ways are considered to be different if there is at least one node that has different parents in both ways.

Return:

  1. 0 if ways == 0
  2. 1 if ways == 1
  3. 2 if ways > 1

A rooted tree is a tree that has a single root node, and all edges are oriented to be outgoing from the root.

An ancestor of a node is any node on the path from the root to that node (excluding the node itself). The root has no ancestors.

Example 1:
```
![1](../../assets/tree/2021-04-08/1.png)
```
  Input: pairs = [[1,2],[2,3]]
  Output: 1
  Explanation: There is exactly one valid rooted tree, which is shown in the above figure.

Example 2:
```
![1](../../assets/tree/2021-04-08/2.png)
```
  Input: pairs = [[1,2],[2,3],[1,3]]
  Output: 2
  Explanation: There are multiple valid rooted trees. Three of them are shown in the above figures.

Example 3:

  Input: pairs = [[1,2],[2,3],[2,4],[1,5]]
  Output: 0
  Explanation: There are no valid rooted trees.
 

Constraints:

  1. 1 <= pairs.length <= 10^5
  2. 1 <= xi < yi <= 500
  3. The elements in pairs are unique.
```
##### Code

- Solution One
```
/**
 * @param {number[][]} pairs
 * @return {number}
 */
var checkWays = function(pairs) {
    
};
```
