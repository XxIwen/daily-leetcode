#### Problem Title
[96. Unique Binary Search Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/)
#### Problem Description
```
Given an integer n, return the number of structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) which has exactly n nodes of unique values from 1 to n.

Example 1:
```
![1](../../assets/tree/2021-02-02/1.jpg)
```
  Input: n = 3
  Output: 5

Example 2:

  Input: n = 1
  Output: 1
 
Constraints:

  1. 1 <= n <= 19
```
##### Code

- Solution One
```
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var numTrees = function(n) {
    
};
```
