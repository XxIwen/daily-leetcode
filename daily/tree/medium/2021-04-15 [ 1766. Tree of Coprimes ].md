#### Problem Title
[1766. Tree of Coprimes](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/)
#### Problem Description
```
A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any path.

Example 1:
```
![1](../../assets/tree/2021-04-15/1.jpg)
```
  Input: root = [1,2,3]
  Output: 6
  Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.

Example 2:
```
![1](../../assets/tree/2021-04-15/2.jpg)
```
  Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
  Output: 42
  Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.
 
Constraints:

    1. The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3 * 10^4].
    2. -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
```
##### Code

- Solution One
```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxPathSum = function(root) {
    
};
```
