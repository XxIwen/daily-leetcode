#### Problem Title
[968. Binary Tree Cameras](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-cameras/)
#### Problem Description
```
Given a binary tree, we install cameras on the nodes of the tree. 

Each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.

Calculate the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.

Example 1:
```
![1](../../assets/tree/2021-04-13/1.png)
```
  Input: [0,0,null,0,0]
  Output: 1
  Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.

Example 2:
```
![1](../../assets/tree/2021-04-13/2.png)
```
  Input: [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]
  Output: 2
  Explanation: At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.

Note:

    1. The number of nodes in the given tree will be in the range [1, 1000].
    2. Every node has value 0.
```
##### Code

- Solution One
```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {number}
 */
var minCameraCover = function(root) {
    
};
```
