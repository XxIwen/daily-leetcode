#### Problem Title
[1028. Recover a Tree From Preorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/recover-a-tree-from-preorder-traversal/)
#### Problem Description
```
We run a preorder depth first search on the root of a binary tree.

At each node in this traversal, we output D dashes (where D is the depth of this node), then we output the value of this node.  (If the depth of a node is D, the depth of its immediate child is D+1.  The depth of the root node is 0.)

If a node has only one child, that child is guaranteed to be the left child.

Given the output S of this traversal, recover the tree and return its root.

Example 1:
```
![1](../../assets/tree/2020-10-30/hard_1.png)
```
  Input: "1-2--3--4-5--6--7"
  Output: [1,2,5,3,4,6,7]

Example 2:
```
![1](../../assets/tree/2020-10-30/hard_2.png)
```
  Input: "1-2--3---4-5--6---7"
  Output: [1,2,5,3,null,6,null,4,null,7]

Example 3:
```
![1](../../assets/tree/2020-10-30/hard_3.png)
```
  Input: "1-401--349---90--88"
  Output: [1,401,null,349,88,90]

Note:

  1. The number of nodes in the original tree is between 1 and 1000.
  2. Each node will have a value between 1 and 10^9.
```

##### Code

- Solution One
```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {string} S
 * @return {TreeNode}
 */
var recoverFromPreorder = function(S) {
    
};
