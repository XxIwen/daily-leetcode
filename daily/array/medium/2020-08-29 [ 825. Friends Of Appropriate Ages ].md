[825. Friends Of Appropriate Ages](https://leetcode.com/problems/friends-of-appropriate-ages/)
#### 题目描述
```
Some people will make friend requests. The list of their ages is given and ages[i] is the age of the ith person. 

Person A will NOT friend request person B (B != A) if any of the following conditions are true:

  1. age[B] <= 0.5 * age[A] + 7
  2. age[B] > age[A]
  3. age[B] > 100 && age[A] < 100

Otherwise, A will friend request B.

Note that if A requests B, B does not necessarily request A.  Also, people will not friend request themselves.

How many total friend requests are made?

Example 1:

  Input: [16,16]
  Output: 2
  Explanation: 2 people friend request each other.

Example 2:

  Input: [16,17,18]
  Output: 2
  Explanation: Friend requests are made 17 -> 16, 18 -> 17.

Example 3:

  Input: [20,30,100,110,120]
  Output: 3
  Explanation: Friend requests are made 110 -> 100, 120 -> 110, 120 -> 100.
 

Notes:

  1. 1 <= ages.length <= 20000.
  2. 1 <= ages[i] <= 120.
```

##### 代码

- 解法一
```
/**
 * @param {number[]} ages
 * @return {number}
 */
var numFriendRequests = function(ages) {
    
};
```
