[33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)
#### 题目描述
```
You are given an integer array nums sorted in ascending order, and an integer target.

Suppose that nums is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

If target is found in the array return its index, otherwise, return -1.


Example 1:

  Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
  Output: 4

Example 2:

  Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
  Output: -1

Example 3:

  Input: nums = [1], target = 0
  Output: -1

Constraints:

  1. 1 <= nums.length <= 5000
  2. -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
  3. All values of nums are unique.
  4. nums is guranteed to be rotated at some pivot.
  5. -10^4 <= target <= 10^4
```

##### 代码

- 解法一
```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number}
 */
var search = function(nums, target) {
    
};
```
