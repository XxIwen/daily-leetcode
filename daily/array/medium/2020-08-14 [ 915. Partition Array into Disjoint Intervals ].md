#### Problem Title
[915. Partition Array into Disjoint Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-into-disjoint-intervals/)
#### Problem Description
```
Given an array A, partition it into two (contiguous) subarrays left and right so that:

  1. Every element in left is less than or equal to every element in right.
  2. left and right are non-empty.
  3. left has the smallest possible size.
Return the length of left after such a partitioning.  It is guaranteed that such a partitioning exists.

 

Example 1:

  Input: [5,0,3,8,6]
  Output: 3
  Explanation: left = [5,0,3], right = [8,6]

Example 2:

  Input: [1,1,1,0,6,12]
  Output: 4
  Explanation: left = [1,1,1,0], right = [6,12]
 

Note:

  1. 2 <= A.length <= 30000
  2. 0 <= A[i] <= 10^6
  3. It is guaranteed there is at least one way to partition A as described.
```

##### Code

- Solution One
```
/**
 * @param {number[]} A
 * @return {number}
 */
var partitionDisjoint = function(A) {
    
};
```
