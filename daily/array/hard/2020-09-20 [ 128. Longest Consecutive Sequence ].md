[128. Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/)
#### 题目描述
```
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

Example:

  Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
  Output: 4
  Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
```

##### 代码

- 解法一
```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var longestConsecutive = function(nums) {
    
};
```
