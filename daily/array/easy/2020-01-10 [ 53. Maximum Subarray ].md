#### Problem Title
[53. Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)
#### Problem Description
```
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Example:

Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

Follow up:

1. If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

##### Code

- Solution One
```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxSubArray = function(nums) {
    
};
```
