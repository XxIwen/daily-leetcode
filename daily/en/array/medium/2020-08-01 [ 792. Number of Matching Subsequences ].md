#### Problem Title
[792. Number of Matching Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-matching-subsequences/)
#### Problem Description
```
Given string S and a dictionary of words words, find the number of words[i] that is a subsequence of S.

Example :
  Input: 
  S = "abcde"
  words = ["a", "bb", "acd", "ace"]
  Output: 3
  Explanation: There are three words in words that are a subsequence of S: "a", "acd", "ace".

Note:

  1. All words in words and S will only consists of lowercase letters.
  2. The length of S will be in the range of [1, 50000].
  3. The length of words will be in the range of [1, 5000].
  4. The length of words[i] will be in the range of [1, 50].
```

##### Code

- Solution One
```
/**
 * @param {string} S
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @return {number}
 */
var numMatchingSubseq = function(S, words) {
    
};
```
