```
  The above elevation map is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped. Thanks Marcos for contributing this image!

Example:

  Input: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
  Output: 6
```

##### Code

- Solution One
```
/**
 * @param {number[]} height
 * @return {number}
 */
var trap = function(height) {
    
};
```
