#### Problem Title
[85. Maximal Rectangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-rectangle/)
#### Problem Description
```
Given a rows x cols binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.

Example 1:
```
![1](../../assets/array/2020-09-26/1.jpg)
```
  Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
  Output: 6
  Explanation: The maximal rectangle is shown in the above picture.

Example 2:

  Input: matrix = []
  Output: 0

Example 3:

  Input: matrix = [["0"]]
  Output: 0

Example 4:

  Input: matrix = [["1"]]
  Output: 1

Example 5:

  Input: matrix = [["0","0"]]
  Output: 0

Constraints:

  1. rows == matrix.length
  2. cols == matrix.length
  3. 0 <= row, cols <= 200
  4. matrix[i][j] is '0' or '1'.
```

##### Code

- Solution One
```
/**
 * @param {character[][]} matrix
 * @return {number}
 */
var maximalRectangle = function(matrix) {
    
};
```
