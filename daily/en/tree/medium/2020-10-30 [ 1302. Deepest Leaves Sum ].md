#### Problem Title
[1302. Deepest Leaves Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/deepest-leaves-sum/)
#### Problem Description
```
Given a binary tree, return the sum of values of its deepest leaves.

Example 1:
```
![1](../../assets/tree/2020-10-30/medium_1.png)
```
  Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,6,7,null,null,null,null,8]
  Output: 15

Constraints:

  1. The number of nodes in the tree is between 1 and 10^4.
  2. The value of nodes is between 1 and 100.
```

##### Code

- Solution One
```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {number}
 */
var deepestLeavesSum = function(root) {
    
};
```
