#### Problem Title
[222. Count Complete Tree Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/)
#### Problem Description
```
Given the root of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Example 1:
```
![1](../../assets/tree/2021-02-23/1.jpg)
```
  Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
  Output: 6

Example 2:

  Input: root = []
  Output: 0

Example 3:

  Input: root = [1]
  Output: 1

Constraints:

  1. The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5 * 10^4].
  2. 0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 10^4
  3. The tree is guaranteed to be complete.
```
##### Code

- Solution One
```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {number}
 */
var countNodes = function(root) {
    
};
```
