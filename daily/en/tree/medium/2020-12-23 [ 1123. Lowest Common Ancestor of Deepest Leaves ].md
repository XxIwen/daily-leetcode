#### Problem Title
[1123. Lowest Common Ancestor of Deepest Leaves](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-deepest-leaves/)
#### Problem Description
```
Given the root of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves.

Recall that:

    1. The node of a binary tree is a leaf if and only if it has no children
    2. The depth of the root of the tree is 0. if the depth of a node is d, the depth of each of its children is d + 1.
    3. The lowest common ancestor of a set S of nodes, is the node A with the largest depth such that every node in S is in the subtree with root A.

Note: This question is the same as 865: https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-subtree-with-all-the-deepest-nodes/

Example 1:
```
![1](../../assets/tree/2020-12-23/1.png)
```
  Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
  Output: [2,7,4]
  Explanation: We return the node with value 2, colored in yellow in the diagram.
  The nodes coloured in blue are the deepest leaf-nodes of the tree.
  Note that nodes 6, 0, and 8 are also leaf nodes, but the depth of them is 2, but the depth of nodes 7 and 4 is 3.

Example 2:

  Input: root = [1]
  Output: [1]
  Explanation: The root is the deepest node in the tree, and it's the lca of itself.

Example 3:

  Input: root = [0,1,3,null,2]
  Output: [2]
  Explanation: The deepest leaf node in the tree is 2, the lca of one node is itself.
 
Constraints:

  1. The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range [1, 1000].
  2. 0 <= Node.val <= 1000
  3. The values of the nodes in the tree are unique.
```
##### Code

- Solution One
```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {TreeNode}
 */
var lcaDeepestLeaves = function(root) {
    
};
```
