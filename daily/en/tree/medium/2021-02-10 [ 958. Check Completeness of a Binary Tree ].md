#### Problem Title
[958. Check Completeness of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-completeness-of-a-binary-tree)
#### Problem Description
```
Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.

In a complete binary tree, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Example 1:
```
![1](../../assets/tree/2021-02-10/1.png)
```
  Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
  Output: true
  Explanation: Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}), and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible.

Example 2:
```
![1](../../assets/tree/2021-02-10/2.png)
```
  Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
  Output: false
  Explanation: The node with value 7 isn't as far left as possible.

Constraints:

  1. The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].
  2. 1 <= Node.val <= 1000
```
##### Code

- Solution One
```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isCompleteTree = function(root) {
    
};
```
