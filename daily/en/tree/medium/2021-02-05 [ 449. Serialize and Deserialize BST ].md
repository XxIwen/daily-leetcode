#### Problem Title
[449. Serialize and Deserialize BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-bst/)
#### Problem Description
```
Serialization is converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary search tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string, and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

The encoded string should be as compact as possible.

Example 1:

  Input: root = [2,1,3]
  Output: [2,1,3]

Example 2:

  Input: root = []
  Output: []

Constraints:

  1. The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
  2. 0 <= Node.val <= 10^4
  3. The input tree is guaranteed to be a binary search tree.
```
##### Code

- Solution One
```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.left = this.right = null;
 * }
 */

/**
 * Encodes a tree to a single string.
 *
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {string}
 */
var serialize = function(root) {
    
};

/**
 * Decodes your encoded data to tree.
 *
 * @param {string} data
 * @return {TreeNode}
 */
var deserialize = function(data) {
    
};

/**
 * Your functions will be called as such:
 * deserialize(serialize(root));
 */
```
