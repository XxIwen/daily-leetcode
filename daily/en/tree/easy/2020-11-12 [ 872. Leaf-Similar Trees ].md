#### Problem Title
[872. Leaf-Similar Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/leaf-similar-trees/)
#### Problem Description
```
Consider all the leaves of a binary tree, from left to right order, the values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.
```
![1](../../assets/tree/2020-11-12/1.png)
```
For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is (6, 7, 4, 9, 8).

Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.

Return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2 are leaf-similar.

Example 1:
```
![1](../../assets/tree/2020-11-12/2.jpg)
```
  Input: root1 = [3,5,1,6,2,9,8,null,null,7,4], root2 = [3,5,1,6,7,4,2,null,null,null,null,null,null,9,8]
  Output: true

Example 2:

  Input: root1 = [1], root2 = [1]
  Output: true

Example 3:

  Input: root1 = [1], root2 = [2]
  Output: false

Example 4:

  Input: root1 = [1,2], root2 = [2,2]
  Output: true

Example 5:
```
![1](../../assets/tree/2020-11-12/3.jpg)
```
  Input: root1 = [1,2,3], root2 = [1,3,2]
  Output: false

Constraints:

  1. The number of nodes in each tree will be in the range [1, 200].
  2. Both of the given trees will have values in the range [0, 200].
```

##### Code

- Solution One
```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root1
 * @param {TreeNode} root2
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var leafSimilar = function(root1, root2) {
    
};
```
