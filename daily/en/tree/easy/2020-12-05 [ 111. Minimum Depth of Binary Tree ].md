#### Problem Title
[111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/)
#### Problem Description
```
Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example 1:
```
![1](../../assets/tree/2020-12-05/1.jpg)
```
     Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
     Output: 2

Example 2:

     Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
     Output: 5
 

Constraints:

     1. The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^5].
     2. -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
```

##### Code

- Solution One
```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {number}
 */
var minDepth = function(root) {
    
};
```
