[1347. Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-steps-to-make-two-strings-anagram/)
#### 题目描述
```
Given two equal-size strings s and t. In one step you can choose any character of t and replace it with another character.

Return the minimum number of steps to make t an anagram of s.

An Anagram of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.

Example 1:

  Input: s = "bab", t = "aba"
  Output: 1
  Explanation: Replace the first 'a' in t with b, t = "bba" which is anagram of s.

Example 2:

  Input: s = "leetcode", t = "practice"
  Output: 5
  Explanation: Replace 'p', 'r', 'a', 'i' and 'c' from t with proper characters to make t anagram of s.

Example 3:

  Input: s = "anagram", t = "mangaar"
  Output: 0
  Explanation: "anagram" and "mangaar" are anagrams. 

Example 4:

  Input: s = "xxyyzz", t = "xxyyzz"
  Output: 0

Example 5:

  Input: s = "friend", t = "family"
  Output: 4
 

Constraints:

  1. 1 <= s.length <= 50000
  2. s.length == t.length
  3. s and t contain lower-case English letters only.
```

##### 代码

- 解法一
```
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string} t
 * @return {number}
 */
var minSteps = function(s, t) {
    
};
```
