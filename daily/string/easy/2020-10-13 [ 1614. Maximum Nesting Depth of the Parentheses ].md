#### Problem Title
[1614. Maximum Nesting Depth of the Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-nesting-depth-of-the-parentheses/)
#### Problem Description
```
A string is a valid parentheses string (denoted VPS) if it meets one of the following:

  1. It is an empty string "", or a single character not equal to "(" or ")",
  2. It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are VPS's, or
  3. It can be written as (A), where A is a VPS.

We can similarly define the nesting depth depth(S) of any VPS S as follows:

  1. depth("") = 0
  2. depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B)), where A and B are VPS's
  3. depth("(" + A + ")") = 1 + depth(A), where A is a VPS.

For example, "", "()()", and "()(()())" are VPS's (with nesting depths 0, 1, and 2), and ")(" and "(()" are not VPS's.

Given a VPS represented as string s, return the nesting depth of s.

Example 1:

  Input: s = "(1+(2*3)+((8)/4))+1"
  Output: 3
  Explanation: Digit 8 is inside of 3 nested parentheses in the string.

Example 2:

  Input: s = "(1)+((2))+(((3)))"
  Output: 3

Example 3:

  Input: s = "1+(2*3)/(2-1)"
  Output: 1

Example 4:

  Input: s = "1"
  Output: 0

Constraints:

  1. 1 <= s.length <= 100
  2. s consists of digits 0-9 and characters '+', '-', '*', '/', '(', and ')'.
  3. It is guaranteed that parentheses expression s is a VPS.
```

##### Code

- Solution One
```
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxDepth = function(s) {
    
};
```
